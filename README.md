2. Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running ```npm init``` in your command line.

3. Make sure to download Inquirer.js by entering "npm install inquirer" in your terminal in the root directory of the project after downloading it onto your local machine. Learn more about this on [npm documentation.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

4. Run ```node <index.js>``` in your terminal in the ```Develop folder``` of the project to launch the application, the first question will appear in your terminal.
